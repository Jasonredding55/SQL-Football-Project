# SQL-Football-Project
SQL data handling project using data from the 23/24 Premier league season.

## Project Overvie
This project aims to demonstrate advanced SQL skills by exploring a large dataset on Premier League football players in the 23/24 Premier league season. The database contains detailed information about each player in the Premier League. The goal is to extract meaningful information from this dataset and present them in a clear and structured manner.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project provides detailed and comprehensive information about every Premier League player from the 2023/24 season. It includes key personal attributes such as age, height, and nationality, as well as in-depth performance metrics like goals, assists, expected goals (xG), and other season statistics. The dataset for this project was sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/orkunaktas/premier-league-all-players-stats-2324.


## Data Processing
The dataset, originally in CSV format, has been converted into a SQL database to enhance usability and streamline data management. This transformation enables more efficient querying, analysis, and integration with advanced data tools. SQL queries have been utilized to clean, filter, and transform the data as necessary. This ensures that the data used for the dashboard is accurate and reliable.



## Project includes:

**Overview:** A summary of key performance indicators, such as total sales, top-performing categories, and regional distribution of sales.

**Sales by NAICS Code:** Visual representations of sales figures for various NAICS codes, allowing users to identify the most significant contributors to overall sales.

**Sales by Category:** Graphs and charts illustrating sales for different categories within Retail and Food Services.

**Geographical Analysis:** Maps and charts showing sales distribution across different regions of the U.S.A.

**Time Series Analysis:** Trends and seasonal patterns in sales data, helping users to identify patterns over time.

**Filtering and Interactivity:** Interactive elements allowing users to filter data based on specific criteria and perform ad-hoc analysis.

## Technologies Used
**SQL:** For data extraction, transformation, and loading into the database.

**Database Management System:** PostgreSQL to host and manage the dataset.

**Programming Languages:**  SQL for data processing and scripting.



**Conclusion**
The Sales for Retail and Food Services in U.S.A. project provides a comprehensive analysis of sales data within the Retail and Food Services sectors. The use of SQL and data from the U.S. government website ensures data accuracy and reliability. The interactive dashboard offers a user-friendly interface to explore the data visually and gain valuable insights. This project is valuable for businesses, policymakers, and researchers looking to understand and leverage sales trends in the U.S.A.
