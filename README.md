# SQL-Football-Project
SQL data handling project using data from the 23/24 Premier league season.

## Project Overview
This project aims to demonstrate advanced SQL skills by exploring a large dataset on Premier League football players in the 23/24 Premier league season. The database contains detailed information about each player in the Premier League. The goal is to extract meaningful information from this dataset and present them in a clear and structured manner. 

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project provides detailed and comprehensive information about every Premier League player from the 2023/24 season. It includes key personal attributes such as age, height, and nationality, as well as in-depth performance metrics like goals, assists, expected goals (xG), and other season statistics. The dataset for this project was sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/orkunaktas/premier-league-all-players-stats-2324.

## Data Processing
The dataset, originally in CSV format, has been converted into a SQL database to enhance usability and streamline data management. This transformation enables more efficient querying, analysis, and integration with advanced data tools. SQL queries have been utilized to clean, filter, and transform the data as necessary. This ensures that the data used for the dashboard is accurate and reliable.
